//# Operations
/**
 * Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple on/off switch that you
 * can use to route traffic to cells. When a routing control state is set to ON, traffic flows to a cell. When
 * the state is set to OFF, traffic does not flow.
 * 
 * Before you can create a routing control, you must first create a cluster, and then host the control
 * in a control panel on the cluster. For more information, see
 * Create routing control structures in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
 * You access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing control state to
 * redirect traffic for your application.
 * 
 * You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster operations
 * to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.
 * 
 * To see a code example for getting a routing control state, including accessing Regional cluster endpoints
 * in sequence, see API examples
 * in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
