Generate a new client with a script like
bun generate --sdk s3

To run the s3 tests:
bun test:local ./test/services/s3.test.ts

To run all service tests:
bun test:local ./test/services/

To run the Protocol tests:
bun test:protocols

To run a single protocol test suite:
bun vitest run ./test/protocols/aws-json-1.0.test.ts

If it is unclear what the XML format for an AWS API is, look up the AWS API reference for that operation.

When asked to explore the smithy models, use `bun -e` to evaluate inline Javascript that loads the JSON in aws-models/models/{service}/{version}.json. the models are too big to load into context. Stick to boring async APIs when using bun -e. Don't bother writing effect just to load, parse and explore JSON files.

Protocol tests must import and use generated request/output classes from ./src/services/*.ts. instead of re-defining them.

We aim to be 1:1 with smithy - all smithy traits make their way into generated code as traits piped to a schema.

The root API client is in [src/api.ts](./src/api.ts).
Which makes use of [request-builder](./src/request-builder.ts) and [response-parser](./src/response-parser.ts).
Protocols are implemented in src/protocols/*.ts.
Protocol tests are in test/protocols/*.test.ts.
Service tests are in test/services/*.test.ts.
Services are generated by [scripts/generate-clients.ts](./scripts/generate-clients.ts) and live in [src/services/](./src/services/).
