    AwsCredentialProviderError: An error has occurred

- apply categories based on prefixes of unknown errors
  - starts with `NoSuch` means its missing
- whatever the hell this is
  - https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy/blob/main/smithy-aws-traits/src/main/java/software/amazon/smithy/aws/traits/auth/diff/SigV4Migration.java#L131
- see if we can merge formatResponse and formatRequest
- get more errors for aws terraform provider
  - see: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/internal/service/s3/errors.go
  - see: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/internal/service/ec2/errors.go
- don't commit src/services
- warning for people who don't know how to bundle

## Testing
- generate a report on kb per bundle (see effect 4 / effect-smol?) @sam
- support smithy's testing suite for parsers?
  - e.g. https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy/tree/main/smithy-aws-protocol-tests/model/restJson1
- measure memory impact
- test coverage reporting

## Performance
- default sigV4service name to lowercase sdkId when it works
- make name smaller
- make everything into thunks
